            //to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk.The city provides its citizens with 
            //a Walk Generating App on their phones-- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one - letter strings
            //representing directions to walk(eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']).You always walk only a single block for each letter (direction)
            //and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk
            //the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes(you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you
            //to your starting point. Return false otherwise.


            //Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters('n', 's', 'e', or 'w'
